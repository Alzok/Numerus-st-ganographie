# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
The repository is split between `backend/` (FastAPI service) and `frontend/` (Next.js UI). Core watermark primitives live in `backend/core/` (I/O helpers, metrics, DWT+DCT pipeline) and routes are registered in `backend/app.py`. Automated checks sit in `backend/tests/`, currently covering watermark round-trip scenarios. The `frontend/app/` directory holds the main page shell and `frontend/components/` hosts reusable UI pieces. Docker orchestration is defined in `docker-compose.yml`, with developer shortcuts in the root `Makefile`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
`make up` rebuilds images and launches the stack (FastAPI on 8080, Next.js on 3000) with live reload. `make test` runs the backend Pytest suite inside the backend container. `make lint` triggers Ruff and Black in check mode, while `make format` applies Black fixes. For frontend-only iterations you can run `docker compose run --rm frontend npm run dev` to start a fresh dev server without touching the backend service.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Python code is formatted with Black (88-character lines, 4-space indents) and linted by Ruff; keep functions type-annotated and use snake_case for modules, variables, and function names. New watermark utilities should land under `backend/core/`, and additional FastAPI endpoints go through `backend/app.py`. TypeScript follows the Next.js ESLint defaultsâ€”match the existing two-space indentation, prefer PascalCase for React components, camelCase for hooks/utilities, and colocate UI primitives under `frontend/components/ui/`. Annotate client-side entry points with `"use client"` as in `frontend/app/page.tsx`.

## Testing Guidelines
Add backend tests as `test_*.py` modules in `backend/tests/`, mirroring the structure of `test_roundtrip.py` for new scenarios (e.g., alternate compression paths or edge cases around PDF pagination). Run `make test` before pushing and update fixtures when metrics assumptions (PSNR, confidence) change. When frontend changes affect user flows, document manual verification steps in the pull request.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Write commit messages in the imperative mood and focus each commit on a single concern. Rebase and resolve conflicts locally to keep history linear. Pull requests should include a concise summary, affected endpoints or UI areas, testing evidence (`make test`, manual checks), and relevant screenshots/GIFs for UI adjustments. Link issues when available and flag configuration changes that require rebuilding Docker images.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Keep secrets out of version control; Docker Compose already wires local development credentials. Backend PDF support depends on `poppler-utils`, so adjust `backend/Dockerfile` when new system packages are required and clear `/tmp` artifacts after experiments.
